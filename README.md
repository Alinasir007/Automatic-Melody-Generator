## What are the Constituent Elements of Music?

Music is essentially composed of Notes and Chords. Let me explain these terms from the perspective of the piano instrument:

    Note: The sound produced by a single key is called a note
    Chords: The sound produced by 2 or more keys simultaneously is called a chord. Generally, most chords contain at least 3 key sounds
    Octave: A repeated pattern is called an octave. Each octave contains 7 white and 5 black keys

You can download the dataset from the given *dataset* folder or any other folder of your choice.

    This project was made by me out of my boredom during covid-19 and interest in music. There is skill scope for refining this using different DL concepts.
    Also I have used just the PIANO notes in this code because of my love for the tune. You are free to modify it based on your interest.
